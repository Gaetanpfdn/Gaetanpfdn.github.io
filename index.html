    <p> <b>Make</b> \Ààme…™k\ : to produce something, often using a particular substance or material.
    <br><br><b>Your</b> \j ä…π\, \j…î…π\, \j…ö\ :the possessive form of you.
    <br><br><b>Mark</b> \ma Åk\ : a typical feature or one that allows you to recognize someone or something or a small area on the surface of something that is damaged, dirty, or different in some way.</p><br>
    <p> üëÅ<span>&nbsp;</span> The original idea for the creative experience we offer you here to explore came from a literal translation of the Make Your Mark meaning. The idea is to give you the tools to re-appropriate yourself in order to come
modify a visual material according to your vision of what it should be. <br><br> ü§î <span>&nbsp;</span> The more global creative approach here is also to question the appropriation of our tools as a designer.
The subject of Make your mark also involves questioning "How to make your mark". <br><br> üî• <span>&nbsp;</span>You will find below home-made templates that allow you to explore tools developed by hand by frog designers so that everyone can reappropriate them and be able to propose their brand via a common platform, designer or not!
<b>No one should censor his creativity because of his lack of accessibility to tools.</b> Make them.
